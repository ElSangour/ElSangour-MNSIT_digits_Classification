# MNIST Digit Classification

## Overview

This project is part of a **Deep Learning course** at **ENSI**. The aim is to classify handwritten digits (0-9) from the **MNIST** dataset using a neural network model. We built and trained a model on this dataset, evaluated its performance, and visualized misclassifications to understand model behavior.

## Project Structure

This Jupyter Notebook contains the following sections:

1. **Importing Necessary Libraries**: Libraries such as TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn are imported for building the model and visualizing the results.
   
2. **Data Preparation**: The MNIST dataset is loaded and visualized. The training and test datasets are preprocessed by normalizing pixel values between 0 and 1 and reshaping the data for the neural network.

3. **Model Architecture**: A simple neural network (or convolutional neural network) is constructed to classify the digits. The architecture consists of layers such as Dense, Dropout, and Activation layers (ReLU, Softmax).

4. **Model Training**: The model is trained on the training set using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function. Training metrics, such as accuracy and loss, are tracked.

5. **Evaluation**: The model is evaluated on the test set, and its accuracy and confusion matrix are computed. Misclassified examples are visualized to analyze where the model is underperforming.

6. **Visualization**: Various plots are generated to show the model's performance. The confusion matrix provides insight into common misclassifications, while visualizations of misclassified digits help identify patterns.

## Installation and Setup

To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (for confusion matrix)

### Clone the repository (if applicable)

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
Install the dependencies
```
```bash

pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```
Running the Code

To run the project:

    Open the Jupyter Notebook (MNIST_Digit_Classification.ipynb) or upload it to Google Colab.
    Run all cells in the notebook sequentially.
    The dataset will be automatically loaded using TensorFlow or PyTorch utilities.
    Training will begin, and the accuracy and loss plots will be displayed during the process.
    After training, evaluate the model on the test set, and visualize the confusion matrix and misclassified digits.

## Dataset

The dataset used is MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology), a widely used benchmark dataset in deep learning and computer vision for handwritten digit recognition. It contains:

    60,000 training images
    10,000 test images
    Images are 28x28 pixels, grayscale, with labels from 0 to 9.

The dataset can be loaded directly using the following code:

python

from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist

(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = mnist.load_data()

## Model Summary

    Architecture: 2 Dense Layers (fully connected)
    Activation Functions: ReLU, Softmax
    Optimizer: Adam
    Loss Function: Categorical Cross-Entropy
    Metrics: Accuracy

Model Layers (Example):

    Input Layer: Flatten (28x28 pixels)
    Hidden Layer: Dense (128 units, ReLU activation)
    Output Layer: Dense (10 units, Softmax activation)

### Training Results:

    Training Accuracy: ~99%
    Test Accuracy: ~98%
    Loss: Categorical Cross-Entropy

### Visualization and Results

    Confusion Matrix: Displays the model's accuracy for each digit (true vs. predicted labels).
    Misclassified Digits: Examples of digits that the model incorrectly classified are shown, with both predicted and true labels.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of a neural network in classifying handwritten digits. While the model achieves high accuracy, misclassifications are still present, often involving visually similar digits such as 9 and 4, or 5 and 6. Further improvements can be made by experimenting with more complex architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
